Introduction:
-----------------
  This plugin will help user in quick traversal between various directories in a project, across the filesystems. This allows user to create shortcuts to directories. All shortcuts created by user are persistent across sessions and are available through the menu. Users who don't have a graphical interface can access menu through wild menu options.
   All shortcuts created are stored in a text file which user can modify, if he has confidence. 
                  Support for adding current directory to shortcuts and direct access to shortcuts file has been given.(v 1.01)


Usage:
---------
   Use Dir-shortcut menu to add shortcuts and traverse to them.
   All commands of winmanager can be used as earlier. A summary of what might be needed by you follows:
   :WManager	to start Windows manager
   :WMClose	to close it
   :WMtoggle	to toggle between visible and hidden modes of winmanager.

 Testing:
 ----------
 	I'm using these scripts from about a month now and feel they work good enough to be released to users.

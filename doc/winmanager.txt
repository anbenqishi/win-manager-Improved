  (this plugin utilizes the bufexplorer plugin made by Jeff Lanzarotta
   and the |file-explorer| made by M A Aziz Ahmed  and Mark Waggoner)

                                                         *winmanager-plugin*

winmanager.vim is a plugin which implements a classical windows type IDE in
Vim-6.0, where the directory and buffer browsers are displayed in 2 windows
on the left and the current editing is done on the right. When you open up
a new file, simply type in :WManager. This will start up the file explorer.

Note This plugin is available only if 'compatible' is not set
     You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_winmanager"
     variable >
        :let loaded_winmanager = 1

{Vi does not have any of this}

COMMANDS                                               *winmanager-commands*
>
:WManager               (re)starts the Windows manager >

:WMClose                closes the file and buffer explorer areas >

:GotoBufExplorerWindow  directly takes you to the buffer list window.
    its useful to put the following mapping in your .vimrc if you frequently
    travel back and forth between file editing and the buffer list >
        :map <c-w><c-b> :GotoBufExplorerWindow<cr>

GotoFileExplorerWindow : directly takes you to the file explorer window.
   its useful to put the following mapping in your .vimrc if you frequently
   travel back and forth... >
        :map <c-w><c-f> :GotoFileExplorerWindow<cr>

============================================================================
SETTINGS                                               *winmanager-settings*

The values of the following global variables should be set in your .vimrc
file if you want a different value than the default:

g:persistentBehaviour: if set to 0, then as soon as you quit all the files
    and only the explorer windows are the ones left, vim will quit. the
    default is 1, which means that the explorer windows persist even if
    they are the only ones visible.
g:bufExplorerWidth: the width of the file and buffer explorer areas. 
    (default 25)
                                                      *bufexplorer-settings*
g:bufExplorerMaxHeight: the buffer list window dynamicall rescales itself to
    occupy only the minimum space required to display all the windows. you
    can set a maximum number of lines for this window. (defualt 15)
g:bufExplorerDetailedHelp (defaut 0): this is a option for the buffer explorer
    which controls whether a detailed list of availabe commands is displayed
    in the header. this can be toggled using the "?" key while in the buffer
    explorer. useful for checking mappings available.
g:bufExplorerSortBy (default "name"): this option controls which criterion
   (name, buffer number or MRU) is used to control the sorting in the buffer
   explorer. this option can be toggled using the 's' key while in the buffer
   explorer.
                                                    *fileexplorer-settings*
See |explorer| for details. Some of the settings used in filexplorer.vim are
not utlized in winmanager, however.

DETAILED HELP                                            *winmanager-details*

When winmanager starts up, it divides the whole vim window into
3 ''regions'', shown below. The mappings which work in each area 
are explained below

             +----+-------------------+
             |    |                   |
             |    |      3(i)         |
             | 1  |                   |
             |    +-------------------+
             |    |                   |
             +----+      3(ii)        |
             | 2  |                   |
             +----+-------------------+
             
1: File Explorer Area 
This area displays the current directory. Its a modification of the standard
explorer.vim which ships with vim6.0. the following actions can be taken in
this area
<enter> : if on a directory, enters it and displays it in the same area. If
          on a file, then opens it in the File Editing Area. Attempts to open in the
          same window as the one visited before, otherwise split open a new window
          horizontally. if this sounds a bit confusing, it isnt. its the
          most intuitive behaviour that one expects.
<tab> : open the file or directory in a new window in the FileEditing area. 
c : change the pwd to the directory currently displayed 
C : change the currently displayed directory to pwd (converse of c) 
    this helps in changing to different drives in windows. i.e, if you are
    currently on the c: drive and you want to change to the d: drive, you
    will have to do 
    cd d:\
    and then press 'C' in the file explorer area.
s : select sort field (size, date, name) 
r : reverse direction of sort 
R : rename file 
D : delete file (or range of files in visual mode)
- : move up one level
<F5> : refresh the file list
double-click : the same as <enter>

2. Buffer Explorer Area
<enter> : Attempts to open the file in the same window as the one visited
          before, otherwise split open a new window horizontally. 
<tab> : open the file in a new window in the FileEditing area. 
s : select sort field (name, buffer number, most recently accessed)
    when in "most recently accessed" mode, the sort order is displayed as
    "MRU", which stands for "Most Recently Used".
r : reverse direction of sort 
<up>/<down>/k/j : ehoes the full file name of the buffer under the cursor.
       this enables only the last part of the file name to displayed in the
       explorer window itself so that it can be kept narrow.
q : quit the buffer explorer

This window is dynamically rescaled and re-displayed. i.e, when a new window
opens somehwere, the buffer list is automatically updated. also, it tries to
occupy the minimum possible space required to display the files. 

3. 
File Editing Area The area where normal editing takes place. The commands in
the File Explorer and Buffer Explorer shouldnt affect the layout of the
windows here. Two mappings which I find useful (which should be placed in
your .vimrc if you plan on using WManager often) is 
>
        map <c-w><c-b> :GotoBufExplorerWindow<cr>
        map <c-w><c-f> :GotoFileExplorerWindow<cr>
        map <c-w><c-t> :WMToggle<cr>

Pressing CTRL-W-B should then take you directly to the buffer list area
where you can switch easily between buffers. Similarly pressing
CTRL-W-F should take you to the File explorer area. CTRL-W-T will toggle
between the winmanager visible and invisible.

BUGS                                                         *winmanager-bug*

Please send any comments for improvements or bug-reports to >
   srinath@eecs.berkeleyedu
If the bug is repeatable, then it will help if a short description of the
events leading to the bug are also given.
Note "I dont like winmanager" is not a bug report, only an opinion ;-)

THANKS                                                    *winmanager-thanks*

I am really grateful to all those who emailed me with bug-reports and comments
for improvement. In particular, Colin Dearing gave many useful suggestions for
improvement which lead to the current version which "remembers" the directory
listing making re-opening WManager on a previously displayed directory much
much faster. I must also add that most of winmanager.vim was already available
as plugins made by others. Many thanks to them (I mention them at the
beginning) for making this possible.

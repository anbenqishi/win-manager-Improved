README
------
  This plugin will help user in quick traversal between various 
directories in a project, across the filesystems. This allows user to
create shortcuts to directories. All shortcuts created by user are
persistent across sessions and are available through the menu. Users
who don't have a graphical interface can access menu through wild 
menu options.
   All shortcuts created are stored in a text file which user can 
modify, if he has confidence. 

Installation:
------------

Place file    addToWinManager.vim in your plugin directory(done 
	      automatically if you unzip the files in your $VIMRUNTIME directory).

and you are through with it. Just start your gvim/vim

Usage:
------
   Use Dir-shortcut menu to add shortcuts and traverse to them.
   All commands of winmanager can be used as earlier. A summary of what might be needed by you follows:
   :WManager	to start Windows manager
   :WMClose	to close it
   :WMtoggle	to toggle between visible and hidden modes of winmanager.

 Tips:
 ----
    To create a sub-menu just give a dot in nic-name of the shortcut. Eg: for Doc.html will create a submenu Doc in Dir-shortcuts, and later if you add Doc.Tex will create another entry in Tex in Doc submenu.
